# Project3_GraphMaze
Old project, but a good one. Uses shortest a shortest path algorithm (can't remember which one off the top of my head) to generate a random maze with exactly one solution, and prints it to the console. Then proceeds to generate a .ppm image file for the maze because it's cool and I wanted to!
